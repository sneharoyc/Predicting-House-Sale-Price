# PREDICTION OF SALES PRICE OF HOUSES WITH MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Multiple linear regression (MLR): investigate the statistical relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables or predictors.

Random Forest (RF) regression:makes a prediction based on the average prediction of a collection of trees and prevents overfitting.

Experimental design in the workflow includes a six-step framework. 
Importing the data and descriptive analysis, Data preparation and selection of variables, Splitting the data, Model fitting, Checking model assumptions, Cross-validation and 
Evaluation of performance.

Performance metrices: ‘Numeric Scorer’ , RMSE, MAPE and coefficient of determination(R2)
